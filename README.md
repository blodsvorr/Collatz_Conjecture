# Collatz Conjecture
Program to Explore the Collatz Conjecture

The Collatz Conjecture:

Given any positive integer x

If x is even, x = x / 2

If x is odd, x = 3x + 1

Applying these rules recursively will always result in x = 1

This program displays a primitive ASCII graph which
  illustrates the steps of the recursion from
  a starting number to its resolution.
  
Running code that takes a number input provided by the user:

First written in Java (2 .java files in repo).
Later translated into JavaScript and refactored
  to simulate the console ouput of the Java version.
